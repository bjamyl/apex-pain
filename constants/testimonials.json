It was so awful and I was in so much pain all of the time. Various other treatments with other doctors helped a small amount big didn't last.\nWhen I met Dr. Mahmoud,\nhe suggested a trial of a spinal cord stimulator. The trial went perfectly! A few weeks later the permanent unit was put in and I can now walk without a walker and enjoy life again! I'm so grateful for this second chance at life! Thank you Dr. Mahmoud!"
